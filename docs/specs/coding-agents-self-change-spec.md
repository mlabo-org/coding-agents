# Coding Agents Self-Change And Legacy Cleanup Spec

This document is a tracked source specification for confirmed Coding Agents
behavior. It is not workflow state and must not be treated as a generated
`docs/codex` log.

## Confirmed Boundary

Items 1-10 are Coding Agents self changes. Item 11 is external legacy cleanup.

1. State directory
   - Coding Agents runtime/workflow state belongs under `<git-root>/.coding-agents/`.
   - The state directory is resolved from the jobsite/target repository git root,
     not from the invocation repository or plugin source repository unless that
     repository is also the target.
   - `invocation_cwd` is the directory where Codex or the source CLI was launched.
     `jobsite`, `target cwd`, and `target-cwd` identify the repository being
     planned, repaired, edited, or audited.
   - If no target is named, `invocation_cwd` remains the jobsite. This preserves
     the default `cwd is jobsite` behavior.
   - If the user names another target, or the CLI receives `--target-cwd <path>`,
     the named target becomes the jobsite and owns `.coding-agents/`.
   - If target selection or the target git root is ambiguous, missing, outside
     the active scope, or unresolved, stop before edits or workflow state writes
     and ask for the intended target.

2. Git non-pollution
   - Generated local state must avoid polluting the target repository.
   - Use the target repository's `.git/info/exclude` for local ignore rules.
   - Do not broaden tracked `.gitignore` files just to hide Coding Agents local
     state unless the user explicitly asks for that repository policy change.

3. Conditional runner log
   - `runner.md` is an operational log, not a universal required source document.
   - Create or update it only when assignment, worker-result collection,
     task-finalization, or record-only orchestration activity actually occurs.
   - Existing historical `process-runner-result` and legacy
     `parent-integration` packets remain readable for backward validation.
     Current commands do not emit either historical packet type.
   - Do not require `runner.md` for unrelated intake/spec/documentation flows.

4. Subagent workflow-state lifecycle
   - Dispatch actual workers only through the official Codex subagent spawn
     tools exposed in the current session. The source CLI must never launch
     `codex exec`, an OS child Codex worker, or a custom runner fallback.
     When official subagent tools are unavailable, work remains parent-side.
   - Subagents must return concise worker-result material and must not stay
     open waiting for more work after returning it.
   - `collect` requires `--lifecycle-disposition state_retired` or
     `--lifecycle-disposition continuation_expected`. `state_retired` requires
     exactly one allowed `--cancel-reason`; `continuation_expected` rejects a
     cancel reason and records `cancel_reason: none`.
   - Current task state records `lifecycle_contract_version: workflow_state_v1`
     and `lifecycle_contract_effective_at`. New `worker-result-collection`
     packets record the same lifecycle contract version,
     `lifecycle_scope: workflow_state_only`, the selected
     `lifecycle_disposition`, `cancel_reason`,
     `runtime_thread_disposition: unmanaged_by_workflow_cli`, and
     `runtime_changed: false`.
   - These fields describe workflow state only. The CLI must not emit or accept
     `runtime_thread_closed: true`, and interruption or process exit is not
     runtime-thread closure evidence.
   - Fieldless current packets are invalid. Pre-contract workflow state and
     non-current packets that predate the recorded activation time remain
     `unknown_legacy`; normalization and validation must not synthesize a
     retirement decision for them.
   - The assignment scaffold stores this lifecycle rule once as a shared
     contract. Actual assignment packets, runner packets, and handoff material
     carry the complete worker-facing fields so future job state preserves it.

5. Subagent supervision and finite delegation depth
   - Delegation hierarchy must be finite. Valid modes are `none`, `one_level`,
     and `n_level`.
   - `none` means no descendant delegation and requires `max_depth: 0`,
     `depth: 0`, and `remaining_depth: 0`.
   - `one_level` permits direct children only. The assigned worker receives
     `max_depth: 1`, `depth: 0`, and `remaining_depth: 1`; its direct children
     receive `depth: 1` and `remaining_depth: 0`.
   - `n_level` permits a bounded descendant chain only when the parent provides
     finite `max_depth`, current `depth`, and calculated `remaining_depth`.
   - Every dispatched subagent assignment must include the finite hierarchy
     fields. The fixed 14-role scaffold stores shared defaults once instead of
     duplicating them in every inactive role slot. Infinite or unbounded depth
     is invalid. Descendants inherit supervision,
     cancellation, scope, depth, and permission limits and may narrow but never
     broaden them.
   - Long-running or delegated assignments must carry supervision fields:
     `heartbeat_interval`, `heartbeat_deadline`, `max_silence`,
     `soft_timeout`, `hard_timeout`, `no_interrupt_until`, and
     `cancel_reason_required: true`.
   - Silence before `heartbeat_deadline` or `no_interrupt_until` is neutral and
     must not trigger cancellation, interruption, workflow `state_retired`,
     replacement, or reassignment by itself.
   - Heartbeats and progress reports are telemetry only. They are not completion
     evidence, verification evidence, root-cause evidence, or permission to
     broaden scope.
   - A `state_retired` workflow disposition must record exactly one allowed
     reason: `completed_retire`, `user_stop`, `safety_stop`, `scope_violation`,
     `stale_timeout`, `blocker_or_failure`, or `stale_premise`.
   - Cancellation for quiet staleness must follow this path: missed heartbeat,
     soft ping or status request, grace wait, stale mark, then cancel or replace
     only if the worker remains silent, returns invalid status, violates scope,
     or crosses the hard timeout.
   - The parent retains policy, cancellation judgment, replacement assignment,
     final result acceptance, and final integration.

6. Debugging integrity
   - Debug or repair work is complete only when the root cause is identified,
     fixed, and verified against the intended outcome.
   - Bug analysis must start from first principles: expected outcome, actual
     behavior, invariants, inputs, execution path, evidence, and competing
     hypotheses before selecting a fix.
   - Log-only, error-message-only, exception-catch-only, skip-only,
     fallback-only, failure-output-only, and return-to-main-loop-only changes are
     temporary containment at most and must not be accepted as debug completion.
   - Fallback implementations that hide main-flow errors are prohibited as a
     repair route. A user-explicit temporary containment may be recorded only as
     containment, with unresolved root cause, failing main flow, residual risk,
     and removal condition visible.
   - Generated assignments, runner packets, audit material, and
     handoff material must carry this debugging integrity rule so delegated work
     preserves it.
   - Existing `.coding-agents` state that predates this rule is stale when
     assignments, handoff material, runner docs, or runner packets lack the
     debugging integrity gate. Validation must not be weakened to accept stale
     state; use an explicit normalization command or regenerate intake state.

7. Meta-Cognitive Debug/Repair Gate
   - Debug, repair, source-of-truth correction, plugin-contract correction,
     generated-artifact inconsistency investigation, generated state versus
     source mismatch, cache/runtime versus source mismatch, and stale contract
     repair are context-impact work, not only local patch work.
   - Assignments, audits, handoffs, runner packets, and final reports for this
     gate must separate the intended contract, observed mismatch, affected
     source/generated/cache/runtime surfaces, changed assumptions, neighboring
     feature impact, before-context effects, after-context effects,
     cross-feature consequences, verification performed, skipped checks,
     unresolved risks, and next investigation.
   - Result quality degrades when Coding Agents stays local. The workflow must
     inspect before/after context effects and cross-feature consequences before
     claiming completion for gate-required work.
   - Passive checklists, prose-only `debugging_integrity`, log-only completion,
     fallback-only completion, skip-only completion, failure-output-only
     completion, hidden-fallback completion, avoidable reimplementation of
     mature OSS, and local-wrapper fixes without premise reconsideration are
     non-completion for gate-required work.
   - If neighboring feature or before/after context checks cannot be completed
     inside the active scope, the skipped checks, reason, remaining risk, and
     next investigation must be recorded instead of treating the gate as passed.

8. Coding Conduct Gate
   - Coding and debug work must carry a machine-visible Coding Conduct Gate in
     the shared assignment scaffold contract, every dispatched assignment and
     runner packet, handoff material, and validation for modern workflow state.
   - If a mature open-source solution exists on GitHub or npm and fits the
     requirement, Coding Agents must reuse it directly instead of
     reimplementing the solved problem.
   - Dependency installation or package adoption still requires that dependency
     addition is inside the active scope, permitted by repository policy, and
     approved when approval is required.
   - When no mature GitHub/npm solution is reused, the worker must record the
     non-reuse reason: scope restriction, policy restriction, mismatch with
     requirements, security/licensing concern, dependency approval not granted,
     or no mature solution found.
   - Bug analysis must begin from first principles before patching: intended
     contract, expected outcome, actual behavior, invariants, inputs, execution
     path, observations, and competing hypotheses.
   - Fallback implementations are prohibited when they hide errors in the main
     flow, preserve a faulty premise, or allow completion to be claimed without
     fixing the intended path. The correct result is to fix the main flow or
     report unresolved status with the next investigation.
   - User-explicit temporary containment remains allowed only as containment,
     not completion, and must leave the failing main flow and removal condition
     visible.

9. Worker-result collection and task finalization
   - `collect` records a `worker-result-collection` packet plus its
     workflow-state-only lifecycle disposition. Completed collection does not
     require complete task-wide D-*/C-*/source-spec coverage, and multiple
     worker results may be collected before the task is finalized.
   - A collection may carry `finalization_references` relevant to that worker's
     result. Generated assignments and handoff material ask workers for concise
     typed references, while the parent owns the complete task-wide map.
   - `finalize` is the only command that records a modern
     `task-finalization` packet. It requires the current `task_id`, `epoch`, and
     `scope`, validates complete active decision, completion-condition, and
     source/spec coverage, and appends the packet only after validation passes.
   - Language-neutral typed references accepted by this contract are
     `file:<path>` or `path:<path>`, `command:<command> exit:<integer>`,
     `artifact:<ref>`, `packet:<collected-ref>` or
     `collected-packet:<ref>`, `role:<collected-role>` or
     `collected-role:<role>`, and
     `test:<name> result:<pass|fail|integer>`.
   - Placeholder-only `done`, `checked`, and `ok` values remain invalid.
     `bin/coding-agents.mjs` and its contract tests own the acceptance
     predicates; this specification records the command boundary and artifact
     contract rather than replacing executable validation.
   - Intake keeps task coverage compact and outcome-oriented: four accepted
     task decisions and five completion conditions cover the requested outcome,
     scope/runtime boundaries, worker lifecycle, work quality, verification,
     and finalization. Static workflow guardrails remain validator-owned rather
     than becoming additional per-task D-*/C-* mappings.
   - `verify-assignments` and `doctor` validate modern task-finalization
     packets. Legacy `parent-integration` packets remain readable for backward
     validation, and the strict lifecycle rules remain attached to modern
     worker-result collections rather than task-finalization packets.

10. Nested Coding Agents preflight suppression
   - Parent-managed child workers operate under a Coding Agents assignment that
     the parent already selected.
   - Generated assignments, runner packets, and handoff material
     must tell child workers not to ask `coding-agents を使いますか？ [Y/n]` and
     not to start independent nested Coding Agents workflows inside the assigned
     `task_id`/`epoch`/`scope`.
   - Descendant delegation is allowed only when finite hierarchy fields grant
     `remaining_depth > 0`, and it must preserve the same task, epoch, scope
     lineage, inherited supervision, and cancellation rules.
   - This suppression does not authorize scope expansion, destructive
     operations, external sending, commits, cache refresh, plugin activation, or
     unrelated edits.
   - Nested descendants also inherit the finite delegation depth and supervision
     contract. They cannot broaden scope, depth, permissions, or cancellation
     authority.

11. Legacy migration and cleanup
   - Existing legacy locations are cleaned through an explicit migration workflow,
     not by silent deletion or broad automatic rewriting.
   - The migration workflow must perform a preflight backup before destructive or
     move-like actions.
   - Dry-run is the default.
   - Apply mode runs only when the user explicitly requests it.
   - Broad migration apply requires user confirmation.

## Cache Refresh Timing

- Refreshing the plugin cache is separate from source editing.
- Cache refresh must be cautious and happen only after source validation.
- When the source change is intended for publication, commit the validated source
  change before refreshing cache.
- Broad cache refresh requires user confirmation.
- Do not edit `~/.codex/plugins/cache/` as the primary source of truth.

## Operational Instruction

Future implementation work should preserve this split:

- Source self-change work may update the Coding Agents source repository.
- Actual worker dispatch uses only official Codex subagent spawn tools. The
  Coding Agents CLI remains a workflow-state recorder and validator; it never
  launches `codex exec` or substitutes a custom child-process runner.
- Cross-repo source invocation must keep source/cache files separate from the
  target repository's generated `.coding-agents/` state. Running the source CLI
  from the plugin repository does not make the plugin repository the state owner
  when `--target-cwd` or an explicit target points elsewhere.
- Generated job state must preserve nested Coding Agents preflight suppression,
  finite delegation depth, subagent supervision and cancellation rules through
  one shared scaffold contract plus complete dispatched packet fields,
  workflow-state lifecycle disposition without runtime-thread closure claims,
  concise worker-result and result-reference rules, parent-owned task
  finalization with typed Contract Coverage, the Coding Conduct Gate, debug
  root-cause completion requirements, and metacognitive context-impact checks
  for gate-required work.
- Stale generated state must be normalized explicitly before verification is
  treated as current.
- Legacy cleanup work may inspect external target repositories but must remain
  dry-run until the user explicitly requests apply.
- Migration apply and plugin cache refresh are separate user-confirmed steps.
