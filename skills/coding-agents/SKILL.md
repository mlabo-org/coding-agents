description: Use when the user wants the Coding Agents workflow or source CLI to intake a jobsite/target cwd, maintain the target git root's <git-root>/.coding-agents/ workflow state even when invoked cross-repo, assign/collect/run scoped specialist work with task_id/epoch/scope/lifecycle isolation, finite delegation depth, long-running subagent supervision, feature-profile overlays, and --work-type metadata, enforce prompt subagent close/retire handling, enforce debugging root-cause integrity and the metacognitive source-change/debug/repair gate for source-change, debug, repair, source-of-truth, plugin-contract, generated-artifact inconsistency, before/after context, or cross-feature consequences work, print a handoff prompt, audit workflow state, or migrate legacy docs/codex material. Trigger for explicit requests to initialize, plan, execute, coordinate, or audit coding work with the coding-agents plugin or source MVP. Do not use for generic coding edits, and do not treat docs/codex as current workflow state.

# Coding Agents

この `SKILL.md` は、この skill が選択された場合に適用される局所実行契約である。
Codex は、本書の発火前提、作業手順、ツール境界、ファイル境界、出力形式を、この skill のスコープ内で拘束力のある実行条件として扱う。
本書は、システム指示、開発者指示、ユーザーの明示要求、適用される `AGENTS.md`、より局所の実行契約を上書きしない。

## Trigger Boundary

- Use this skill only when the user explicitly asks for the `coding-agents` plugin, Coding Agents workflow, source CLI, subagent development team coordination, `.coding-agents` workflow state, task_id/epoch/scope/lifecycle assignments, finite delegation depth, subagent supervision or cancellation policy, assign/collect/run orchestration, handoff generation, workflow audit, or legacy `docs/codex` migration.
- Do not trigger this skill for ordinary one-off code edits, reviews, or explanations unless the user connects the work to Coding Agents.
- Do not trigger this skill merely because a repository contains `docs/codex`. Legacy `docs/codex` is a migration source, not proof that the current workflow is active.
- Do not perform legacy migration apply, plugin cache refresh, marketplace updates, or restart/reload actions unless the active user request includes that boundary.

## Core Contract

- Treat `invocation_cwd` as the directory where Codex or the source CLI was launched. Treat `jobsite`, `target cwd`, and `target-cwd` as the repository being planned, repaired, edited, or audited.
- When the user does not name another target, `invocation_cwd` is the jobsite. This preserves the default `cwd is jobsite` intake rule.
- When the user names a different repair/edit target, or the source CLI receives `--target-cwd <path>`, the named target is the jobsite. The invocation repository does not own workflow state for that target.
- Resolve the jobsite's Git root before writing workflow state. The active state root is the jobsite repository's `<git-root>/.coding-agents/`, even when `invocation_cwd` is a plugin, tooling, or parent repository.
- If the jobsite, target cwd, or target Git root is ambiguous, missing, outside the active task scope, or cannot be resolved, stop before state writes or edits. Report the ambiguity and ask for the intended target.
- If no Git root can be resolved for the jobsite, do not invent a state path. Report the blocker or ask for the intended repository root.
- Before creating or updating the jobsite repository's `<git-root>/.coding-agents/`, ensure that repository's `.git/info/exclude` ignores `.coding-agents/`. Add only that local exclude entry when it is missing.
- Do not auto-edit the repository's tracked `.gitignore` to hide Coding Agents state. Edit tracked ignore policy only when the user explicitly requests that repository policy change.
- The first action after trigger is target resolution followed by project intake. Determine `invocation_cwd`, resolve the jobsite from the explicit target or default cwd rule, read the local `AGENTS.md` chain that applies to the jobsite when available, inspect the jobsite repository shape, check Git state, resolve `<git-root>`, inspect existing `.coding-agents` state, inspect `.git/info/exclude`, and identify legacy `docs/codex` material only as migration input.
- During source upgrade work, direct execution of the source CLI runs source-tree behavior: `node /Users/suzukimakoto/plugins/coding-agents/bin/coding-agents.mjs ...`. This validates source behavior, not installed plugin activation.
- Installed plugin activation is controlled by refreshing the plugin cache from validated source and then restarting Codex or opening a new thread when required. Do not claim a source CLI run proves cached plugin activation.
- Maintain `<git-root>/.coding-agents/` as the workflow SSOT for the active job.
- When the user confirms a design or operating decision, record it as an accepted decision, convert it into actionable specification, and audit execution against it after implementation.
- The parent agent owns task decomposition, policy decisions, user consultation, conflict resolution, final integration, explicit subagent close/retire handling, and final reporting.
- Subagents own research, implementation material, verification material, and isolated findings. They do not own final policy or final user-facing synthesis.
- After a subagent result is integrated, after hard-timeout/failure/blocker handling, after a stale premise or scope change, and before the final report when no further use is expected, the parent must close or retire each no-longer-needed subagent promptly under the supervision and cancellation rules.
- A subagent's explicit completed, blocked, or failed result is not silence. It must immediately trigger parent collection, integration, and the appropriate close/retire or replacement decision; `heartbeat_deadline` and `no_interrupt_until` protect only quiet workers that have not returned a result.

## Debugging Integrity Gate

- When the active task is DEBUG, debug, bug fix, repair, test failure, regression, "not working", "expected result is not produced", or any equivalent failure-correction request, Coding Agents must treat the goal as root-cause discovery and restoration of the intended outcome.
- Coding Agents must not accept log-only, error-message-only, exception-catch-only, skip-only, fallback-only, continue-only, return-to-main-loop-only, or failure-output-only changes as completed debug work.
- Error handling, logging, fallback, and graceful return behavior do not replace root-cause analysis. If they are added before the root cause is identified and fixed, record them as temporary containment, not completion.
- Debug assignments and handoff material must require the worker to identify the expected outcome, actual failure, reproduction path, failure point, root cause, fix, and verification that the intended outcome now works.
- The parent must reject or reassign any subagent result that claims completion without a root cause and outcome verification for a debug or repair task.
- The final Coding Agents report for debug or repair work must separate root cause, fix, and verification. If root cause remains unknown, report the work as unresolved or temporary containment and name the next investigation step.
- Existing `.coding-agents` state created before this gate is stale when `assignments.md`, `handoff.md`, `runner.md`, or runner packets lack the debugging integrity gate. Do not weaken validation to accept it; normalize the state explicitly with `normalize-debugging-integrity --execute` or regenerate it with intake before treating verification as current.

## Meta-Cognitive Debug/Repair Gate

- This gate fires when the active task is source change, code edit, implementation change, config edit, test edit, canonical document edit, refactor, debug, repair, source-of-truth correction, plugin-contract correction, generated-artifact inconsistency investigation, generated state versus source mismatch, cache/runtime versus source mismatch, stale contract repair, or any work where a local fix can change before/after context or cross-feature behavior.
- The source-change trigger is not optional once Coding Agents has been selected for coding work. Do not let keyword judgment, task smallness, immediate token/latency cost, or apparently simple edits classify source/config/test/canonical/refactor work as non-gate work.
- `--work-type <id>` is semantic command metadata for the source CLI, not a replacement for this gate or the Debugging Integrity Gate. Known ids are `auto`, `documentation`, `source-change`, and `debug`.
- `--work-type auto` preserves keyword/path inference. `--work-type source-change` and `--work-type debug` force the metacognitive gate for that command. `--work-type documentation` suppresses keyword/path gate inference for that command only; it must not downgrade an existing gate-required workflow state or excuse missing root-cause/debug evidence.
- Coding Agents must treat gate-required work as context-impact work, not only local patch work. Result quality degrades when Coding Agents stays local, so assignments, audits, handoffs, runner packets, and final reports must inspect before/after context effects and cross-feature consequences before claiming completion.
- Gate-required work must separate the intended contract, observed mismatch, affected source/generated/cache/runtime surfaces, changed assumptions, neighboring feature impact, before-context effects, after-context effects, cross-feature consequences, verification performed, skipped checks, unresolved risks, and next investigation.
- The parent must require workers to identify whether the mismatch is in source, generated workflow state, cache copy, runtime output, activation state, user request interpretation, or verification criteria before accepting a repair route.
- The parent must reject local-wrapper fixes that preserve a faulty premise. Before adding an adapter, fallback, compatibility branch, defensive return, default filler, or wrapper workflow, reconsider whether the selected route, source-of-truth, plugin contract, data model, generated artifact, cache/runtime surface, or verification target is wrong.
- Passive checklists, prose-only `debugging_integrity` text, log-only completion, fallback-only completion, skip-only completion, failure-output-only completion, and local-wrapper fixes without premise reconsideration are non-completion for gate-required work.
- If a gate-required assignment cannot inspect neighboring features or before/after context within its scope, it must report the skipped check, why it was skipped, the risk that remains, and the next investigation that would close the gap.

## Subagent Operating Model

- Before assigning real work, initialize a fixed 14-role assignment scaffold for the job. This scaffold is a validation and routing structure, not proof that 14 resident agents or spawned workers are active.
- Treat actual specialist execution as assignment instances created later by the parent through available subagent tools or explicit runner packets.
- Every subagent assignment must include `task_id`, `epoch`, `scope`, `lifecycle`, and a finite hierarchy contract:
  - `hierarchy_mode: none` means the worker may not delegate or spawn descendants. Set `max_depth: 0`, `depth: 0`, and `remaining_depth: 0`.
  - `hierarchy_mode: one_level` means the assigned worker may create direct children only. Set `max_depth: 1`, `depth: 0`, and `remaining_depth: 1` for that worker; any direct child receives `depth: 1` and `remaining_depth: 0`.
  - `hierarchy_mode: n_level` means a bounded descendant chain is permitted. The parent must set a positive finite `max_depth`; the assigned worker receives the current `depth` and calculated `remaining_depth`, and each descendant receives incremented `depth` plus decremented `remaining_depth`.
  - Infinite or unbounded delegation depth is invalid. Missing or non-finite `max_depth`, `depth`, or `remaining_depth` is non-completion for delegated assignment material.
- A scoped assignment may also include `--feature-profile <id>`. Treat feature profiles as optional assignment overlays that add routing/debug guidance to that specific assignment instance; they are not additional scaffold roles, resident agents, spawned workers, or a substitute for `task_id`, `epoch`, `scope`, and `lifecycle`.
- Known feature profile ids are `debug.reproducer`, `debug.failure-boundary`, `debug.hypothesis-splitter`, `debug.fix-verifier`, `runner.scope-guard`, `plugin.activation-guard`, `source.cache-boundary`, and `workflow.state-safety`. Unknown ids must fail before `.coding-agents/runner.md` is appended.
- A scoped assignment, integration packet, intake, or runner command may also include `--work-type <id>`. Treat work types as command metadata for gate classification only; they are not roles, feature profiles, lifecycle states, or permission to weaken source-change/debug/root-cause requirements.
- Unknown work type ids must fail before `.coding-agents/runner.md` is appended. Missing `work_type` in existing workflow state or packets means `auto`.
- Treat `task_id` as the unit of user-visible work, `epoch` as the restart boundary for stale context, and `scope` as the allowed file, tool, or investigation boundary.
- When a child worker is operating under a parent-managed Coding Agents assignment, the parent has already selected Coding Agents for that scoped assignment. The child worker must not ask `coding-agents を使いますか？ [Y/n]` and must not start an independent nested Coding Agents workflow. It may delegate descendants only when finite hierarchy fields grant `remaining_depth > 0`, while keeping the same `task_id`, `epoch`, `scope` lineage and inherited supervision. It proceeds directly within the assigned `task_id`, `epoch`, and `scope`, while still stopping before scope expansion, destructive operations, external sending, commits, cache refresh, plugin activation, or unrelated edits.
- Nested descendants inherit the parent supervision and cancellation rules and cannot broaden scope, depth, permissions, allowed tools, external side effects, cache refresh, plugin activation, destructive operations, or Git history permissions. A descendant may narrow scope or use less depth; it must not increase `remaining_depth` or claim a broader `max_depth` than the parent granted.
- Reuse of a subagent context is an exception. The default action after a meaningful task boundary, stale premise, scope change, or failed verification is restart or retire.
- A subagent must return concise parent-integration material: findings, changed files or proposed changes, verification notes, blockers, and unresolved assumptions.
- A subagent must stop after returning integration material. It must not stay open waiting for more work; any continuation requires a fresh explicit assignment or an intentional parent-managed reuse decision.
- When a subagent reaches `hard_timeout` after the stale path, fails, reports a blocker, violates scope, or becomes stale because the premise or scope changed, retire that context with an allowed `cancel_reason` before issuing any replacement assignment.
- If the current environment has no callable subagent mechanism, state that limitation in the work log, keep the role scaffold in the plan, and proceed only with parent-side work that the user requested or that the active environment can perform.

## Subagent Supervision And Cancellation

- Long-running assignments, delegated assignments, and any assignment that may remain quiet while doing valid work must include a supervision block with `heartbeat_interval`, `heartbeat_deadline`, `max_silence`, `soft_timeout`, `hard_timeout`, `no_interrupt_until`, and `cancel_reason_required: true`.
- `heartbeat_interval` is the expected cadence for status telemetry. `heartbeat_deadline` is the first time a missing heartbeat becomes actionable. `max_silence` is the longest allowed silence after grace handling. `soft_timeout` starts status inquiry and reassessment. `hard_timeout` is the outer stop boundary. `no_interrupt_until` is the earliest time the parent may interrupt, retire, replace, or cancel for silence unless a higher-priority safety, user, or scope violation reason applies.
- Silence before `heartbeat_deadline` or before `no_interrupt_until` is neutral. It must not trigger cancellation, interruption, retirement, replacement, reassignment, or negative scoring by itself.
- Completed, blocked, failed, or otherwise terminal worker output is an observed result, not heartbeat silence. The parent must collect and integrate that result as soon as it is visible, then close or retire the worker with `completed_retire`, `blocker_or_failure`, or another applicable allowed reason unless an explicitly scoped continuation remains necessary.
- Heartbeats and progress reports are telemetry only. They are not completion evidence, verification evidence, root-cause evidence, or permission to broaden scope.
- Cancellation, interruption, retirement, or replacement must record exactly one allowed `cancel_reason`: `completed_retire`, `user_stop`, `safety_stop`, `scope_violation`, `stale_timeout`, `blocker_or_failure`, or `stale_premise`.
- `completed_retire` is valid only after the parent has integrated the worker's result or explicitly decided no further use is expected. Use `user_stop` only for explicit user stop or redirect. Use `safety_stop` for policy, privacy, destructive, external-send, authentication, cost, or permission risk. Use `scope_violation` when the worker exceeds assignment boundaries. Use `stale_timeout` only after the stale path below has completed. Use `blocker_or_failure` when the worker reports an actionable blocker or failed result. Use `stale_premise` when the parent premise, scope, or accepted decision changed and continuing that context would mislead the task.
- Before cancelling or replacing a quiet worker for staleness, the parent must follow this path: missed heartbeat after `heartbeat_deadline` -> soft ping or status request -> grace wait until the configured grace point or `max_silence` boundary -> mark stale -> cancel or replace only if the worker is still silent, returns invalid status, violates scope, or is past `hard_timeout`.
- A missed heartbeat, sparse progress, or long-running silence is not a blocker and not a failed result until the stale path or another allowed cancellation reason establishes that state.
- Parent ownership remains intact throughout supervision. The parent owns policy, cancellation judgment, replacement assignment, result acceptance, and final integration; workers and descendants provide telemetry and integration material but do not retire themselves as final policy.

## Workflow State Files

- `<git-root>/.coding-agents/README.md`: reader order and role map for Codex-facing workflow files.
- `<git-root>/.coding-agents/project.md`: project intake summary for the jobsite itself.
- `<git-root>/.coding-agents/task.md`: current task SSOT, including purpose, scope, semantic `work_type`, non-goals, completion conditions, permitted hierarchy mode, and supervision defaults when the task uses long-running or delegated assignments.
- `<git-root>/.coding-agents/todo.md`: executable checklist with stable task IDs.
- `<git-root>/.coding-agents/decisions.md`: accepted decisions with IDs and implementation impact.
- `<git-root>/.coding-agents/audit.md`: audit log, completed checks, skipped checks, next audit needs, debug root-cause verification when the task is a debug or repair task, context-impact or cross-feature checks when the Meta-Cognitive Debug/Repair Gate fires, and any subagent cancellation with its allowed reason and stale-path evidence.
- `<git-root>/.coding-agents/assignments.md`: fixed 14-role assignment scaffold. Each scaffold section must include `role`, `status`, `task_id`, `epoch`, `scope`, `assignment`, `expected_output`, and `lifecycle`; it is not proof that 14 workers are active and must not grow dynamic roles for feature profiles. Long-running or delegated assignment sections must include finite hierarchy fields and supervision fields. Debug or repair tasks must also carry the debugging integrity gate, and gate-required work must carry the Meta-Cognitive Debug/Repair Gate.
- `<git-root>/.coding-agents/handoff.md`: prompt material for the next worker to continue the task, including the subagent rule to return concise integration material, preserve finite delegation depth, inherit supervision and cancellation rules, avoid interrupting quiet workers before heartbeat deadlines, close or retire no-longer-needed workers promptly, reject log-only or fallback-only debug completion, and include context-impact inspection plus cross-feature checks for gate-required work.
- `<git-root>/.coding-agents/runner.md`: conditional operational log for `assign`, `collect`, `run`, `orchestrate`, parent-integration packets, and process results. Runner and integration packets render `feature_profile` as the selected id or `none`, `work_type` as the selected id or `auto`, finite hierarchy fields for each assignment, supervision fields for long-running or delegated work, and `cancel_reason` only from the allowed reason set when cancellation, interruption, retirement, or replacement occurs. Create or update it only when that activity occurs. Do not require `runner.md` for intake, specification, documentation-only, or audit flows that have no runner activity.

## Legacy `docs/codex`

- Treat `docs/codex` as legacy workflow material and migration source only.
- Read legacy `docs/codex` during intake when present so existing task, decision, assignment, audit, and runner context can be preserved intentionally.
- Do not silently delete, move, rewrite, or continue active workflow state in `docs/codex`.
- Migration apply is a separate workflow. Default to dry-run, create a preflight backup before destructive or move-like actions, and apply only after explicit user confirmation.

## Source CLI MVP Workflow

Use the source CLI when the user wants to test source-tree behavior before plugin cache activation, or when the active task is a source upgrade of the Coding Agents plugin itself.

1. Record `invocation_cwd` as the launch directory.
2. Resolve the target jobsite path. Use `--target-cwd <jobsite>` for explicit cross-repo target selection; if no target is provided, use `invocation_cwd` as the jobsite.
3. Resolve the jobsite Git root. Confirm the jobsite repository's `<git-root>/.coding-agents/` as the workflow state root before state writes.
4. Ensure the jobsite repository's `.git/info/exclude` ignores `.coding-agents/`; do not edit tracked `.gitignore` unless explicitly requested.
5. Run intake with explicit isolation keys and optional semantic work metadata:
   `node /Users/suzukimakoto/plugins/coding-agents/bin/coding-agents.mjs intake --target-cwd <jobsite> --work-type <auto|documentation|source-change|debug> --task <task> --task-id <id> --epoch <epoch> --scope <scope>`.
6. Run doctor:
   `node /Users/suzukimakoto/plugins/coding-agents/bin/coding-agents.mjs doctor --target-cwd <jobsite>`.
7. Print handoff when needed:
   `node /Users/suzukimakoto/plugins/coding-agents/bin/coding-agents.mjs handoff --target-cwd <jobsite> --task-id <id>`.
8. If pre-existing `.coding-agents` state lacks the debugging integrity gate, run dry-run first:
   `node /Users/suzukimakoto/plugins/coding-agents/bin/coding-agents.mjs normalize-debugging-integrity --target-cwd <jobsite>`.
   Apply only after confirming the target state directory:
   `node /Users/suzukimakoto/plugins/coding-agents/bin/coding-agents.mjs normalize-debugging-integrity --target-cwd <jobsite> --execute`.
9. For `assign`, `collect`, `run`, or `orchestrate`, record operational packets in the jobsite repository's `.coding-agents/runner.md`. Use `--feature-profile <id>` only as an optional scoped overlay for that assignment instance, and keep missing profiles as `feature_profile: none`. Use `--work-type <id>` only as semantic command metadata for gate classification, and keep missing work types as `work_type: auto`.
   When `run --runner codex-cli` is used, treat `--scope` as runner machine input:
   - Stop before appending `.coding-agents/runner.md` or launching the runner when `--scope` is empty, ambiguous prose, negative/exclusion wording, or otherwise not machine-checkable.
   - Use quoted `--scope "scope:v1 all"` for the whole repo.
   - Use quoted `--scope "scope:v1 paths=README.md,bin/coding-agents.mjs,tests/"` for an affirmative comma-separated repo-relative prefix list.
   - Accept absolute paths only when they resolve inside the target cwd, then normalize them to repo-relative prefixes.
   - Preserve legacy runner compatibility only for simple path-only values such as `README.md`, `allowed/`, `bin/coding-agents.mjs tests/workflow-state.test.mjs`, plus whole-repo aliases `.`, `repo`, and `whole repo`.
   - Keep broader human prose scopes for intake, assign, and collect rather than runner execution.
10. Ensure generated assignments, runner prompts, runner packets, and handoff material carry the nested Coding Agents preflight suppression rule, finite hierarchy rule, supervision and cancellation rule, lifecycle rule, debugging integrity gate, and Meta-Cognitive Debug/Repair Gate when it fires: child workers do not ask `coding-agents を使いますか？ [Y/n]` or start independent nested Coding Agents workflows inside a parent-managed scoped assignment; permitted descendant delegation is allowed only inside finite inherited depth; quiet workers are not interrupted before heartbeat deadlines or `no_interrupt_until`; explicit completed, blocked, or failed worker output bypasses the quiet-worker stale path and triggers immediate collect/integrate/close-or-retire handling; heartbeat and progress telemetry is not completion evidence; stale cancellation follows missed heartbeat -> soft ping/status request -> grace wait -> stale mark -> cancel/replace only if still silent or invalid; subagents return concise integration material, stop waiting for more work, are closed or retired promptly when no longer needed under an allowed cancellation reason, do not claim debug completion through log-only, fallback-only, skip-only, or return-to-main-loop-only changes, and include context-impact inspection plus cross-feature checks for gate-required work.
11. Treat marketplace registration, `~/.codex/plugins/cache/` refresh, and Codex restart/new-thread activation as separate work unless the user explicitly includes them.

If source CLI output still names legacy `docs/codex`, treat that as source implementation drift to report or fix under the active task scope. Do not let legacy output redefine the current skill contract.

## Workflow

1. Record `invocation_cwd`, then resolve the jobsite from the explicit target (`--target-cwd`, user-named project root, or task-owned target path) or from cwd when no target is named.
2. If target selection remains ambiguous, stop before edits or workflow state writes and ask for the intended jobsite.
3. Resolve the jobsite repository's `<git-root>` and run project intake before editing: repository status, applicable instructions, current `.coding-agents` state, `.git/info/exclude` status, legacy `docs/codex` migration input, source/cache boundaries, and risk level.
4. Before workflow state writes, create or update the jobsite repository's local `.git/info/exclude` entry for `.coding-agents/` when missing. Do not update tracked `.gitignore`.
5. Create or update the active `.coding-agents` files before implementation when workflow state is missing or stale.
6. Initialize the fixed 14-role assignment scaffold with `task_id`, `epoch`, `scope`, `lifecycle`, finite hierarchy fields, and supervision defaults for long-running or delegated work; create actual specialist assignments only when scoped work is dispatched. Do not add roles for feature profiles.
7. Execute or coordinate work according to `.coding-agents/todo.md`.
8. Record user-confirmed decisions in `.coding-agents/decisions.md` and update `.coding-agents/task.md` when scope changes.
9. Create or update `.coding-agents/runner.md` only for `assign`, `collect`, `run`, `orchestrate`, parent-integration packet, or process-result activity.
10. Normalize stale pre-gate `.coding-agents` state with `normalize-debugging-integrity` before relying on `verify-assignments` or `doctor` results.
11. After every completed result integration, `hard_timeout`/failure/blocker handling, stale premise, or scope change, close or retire subagents that are no longer needed before issuing new assignments. Do not close, retire, interrupt, or replace a quiet long-running worker before `heartbeat_deadline` and `no_interrupt_until` unless `user_stop`, `safety_stop`, or `scope_violation` applies. Do not apply the quiet-worker wait rule to a worker that has already returned completed, blocked, failed, or otherwise terminal integration material.
12. Verify implementation against the accepted decisions and completion conditions. For debug or repair work, verification must include root cause, fix, and evidence that the intended outcome now succeeds; otherwise mark the task unresolved or temporarily contained. For Meta-Cognitive Debug/Repair Gate work, verification must also include intended contract, observed mismatch, affected source/generated/cache/runtime surfaces, changed assumptions, neighboring feature impact, before-context effects, after-context effects, cross-feature consequences, verification performed, skipped checks, unresolved risks, and next investigation.
13. Before the final report, confirm no subagent remains open unless the user explicitly asked to keep it for a continued assignment or a parent-owned long-running assignment remains inside its valid supervision window. If a supervised worker remains open, report the supervision exception instead of silently cancelling it.
14. Append audit results to `.coding-agents/audit.md`, including checks not run and why. For gate-required work, include context-impact inspection and cross-feature checks or explicitly record why those checks were skipped.
15. Report final status with changed files, verification, open risks, and next TODOs.

## File Boundaries

- Edit jobsite files only inside the active task scope.
- In cross-repo invocation, do not edit the invocation repository merely because Codex or the source CLI was launched there. Edit the invocation repository only when it is also the resolved jobsite or is explicitly inside the active task scope.
- Treat plugin source directories as source of truth. Do not patch `~/.codex/plugins/cache/` as the primary edit target.
- Do not edit `~/.codex/plugins/cache/`, marketplace files, or plugin activation state unless the user explicitly includes that in the active task scope.
- Do not auto-edit tracked `.gitignore` to hide `.coding-agents/`. Use target `.git/info/exclude` for the local workflow-state ignore rule.
- Do not edit legacy `docs/codex` as active workflow state. Edit it only when the active task is an explicit migration, cleanup, or legacy-document maintenance task.
- Preserve unrelated user or worker changes. If another change appears in scope, work around it or report the conflict; do not revert it.
- The MVP CLI uses Node.js standard libraries only. Do not add dependencies to run intake, handoff, or doctor.

## Source And Cache Boundary

- Source repository changes take effect for direct source CLI runs immediately.
- Installed plugin behavior uses the cached plugin copy under `~/.codex/plugins/cache/` and may require a refresh plus Codex restart or a new thread before the updated skill, agent metadata, CLI, or assets are active.
- Refresh cache only from validated source and only for the named plugin in scope. Do not refresh broadly or edit cache files directly.
- When cache activation is out of scope, report that source is updated but plugin activation is pending cache refresh/restart.

## Output Shape

Return concise parent-facing status in the user's language. Include changed files, verification or audit results, remaining blockers, unresolved TODOs, and any subagent lifecycle exception that remains open. For debug or repair work, explicitly separate root cause, fix, and verification; do not report completion when only logging, fallback, skipping, or failure-return behavior was added. For Meta-Cognitive Debug/Repair Gate work, include context-impact inspection, cross-feature checks, skipped checks, unresolved risks, and next investigation. Keep raw subagent logs out of the final answer unless the user asks for them.
