# Coding Agents

Coding Agents is an explicit-only Codex plugin for inspectable coding workflow state. It records intake, bounded assignments, collection, finalization, audit, and handoff packets under `.coding-agents/`. Actual workers are dispatched only through official Codex subagent tools; the source CLI is record-only and never launches `codex exec` or a custom process runner.

Coding Agents is fully usable on its own from specification consultation through bounded implementation and verification. [Agentic Runner](https://github.com/mlabo-org/agentic-runner) is an optional upper control plane for work that spans multiple owners or outputs; neither plugin requires the other to be installed or invoked.

## Standalone Or Paired

- **Coding Agents alone** — discuss a new code specification, turn confirmed decisions into an instruction document, execute bounded assignments, and verify the result against that contract.
- **With Agentic Runner** — keep the same coding workflow while Agentic Runner owns shared constraints, cross-owner routing, supervision, resume checkpoints, and final convergence.

Agentic Runner can also run without Coding Agents, using any other declared owners. The pair is an optional composition, not a set-only product.

## Install

The Agentic Runner repository publishes two independent entries in one shared marketplace. For a standalone Coding Agents install:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add mlabo-org/agentic-runner --ref main
codex plugin add coding-agents@agentic-control-plane
```

That is a complete standalone install. To add the optional upper control plane and form the pair:

```sh
codex plugin add agentic-runner@agentic-control-plane
```

Restart Codex or start a new task after installation.

## Trigger Explicitly

Use the plugin by name:

> Use Coding Agents explicitly to audit this repository. Inspect README.md and package.json, run npm test, make no source changes or commits, and return the workflow-state and verification evidence.

Generic coding, debugging, source changes, delegation, or subagent requests do not automatically select Coding Agents.

## From Specification To Execution

You can begin before a detailed implementation specification exists. Use Codex as a specification partner to discuss desired behavior, users, constraints, interfaces, edge cases, acceptance criteria, validation commands, and forbidden changes. The Coding Agents parent workflow owns this consultation and the resulting decisions.

Once the decisions are confirmed, ask Codex to turn them into an actionable instruction document such as `docs/implementation-brief.md`. A useful brief includes:

- goal and non-goals
- accepted decisions and unresolved questions
- in-scope and out-of-scope files
- functional and nonfunctional requirements
- acceptance criteria and required tests
- permissions, stop conditions, and commit policy

Then execute that contract explicitly:

> Use Coding Agents explicitly. Treat `docs/implementation-brief.md` as the implementation contract. Create the intake and bounded assignments, dispatch workers only through official Codex subagent tools, implement within the declared scope, run every listed validation, and do not commit until I approve.

Coding Agents records confirmed decisions, converts them into actionable specification, and audits the implementation against the source/spec contract before task finalization. This creates a direct path from an early design conversation to verified implementation without losing the decisions made along the way.

## Execution Boundary

- The Codex main thread owns decomposition, policy, safety, integration, verification, and the final response.
- Coding Agents records task identity, epoch, declared scope, scaffold contracts, assignments, results, lifecycle, and handoff state.
- Official Codex subagent tools are the only worker-dispatch route.
- If official subagents are unavailable, execution remains in the parent thread. The CLI does not fall back to an OS child Codex process.
- Runtime state and installed plugin cache are not source.

## Run From Source

The repository has no third-party runtime dependencies. A recent Node.js release and Git are required.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mlabo-org/coding-agents.git
cd coding-agents
npm test
npm run doctor:self
```

Additional checks:

```sh
npm run test:cli
```

`doctor:self` validates the source-tree CLI. It does not claim that a separately installed plugin cache has been refreshed.

## Build Week Extension

The workflow baseline existed before the 2026 OpenAI Build Week eligibility window. The submission asks judges to evaluate only these later extensions:

Agentic Runner and Coding Agents had been under development long before OpenAI Build Week. With the arrival of GPT-5.6, we used GPT-5.6 Sol ULTRA to carry out a large-scale refactor so both plugins would operate correctly in the new Codex environment. GPT-5.6 Sol ULTRA accelerated architecture inspection, specification discussion, cross-file implementation and review, test execution, and the conversion of accepted decisions into public documentation. This was a modernization of a mature baseline, not a claim that the entire project was created during Build Week.

The explicit plugin path targets fine-grained behavior that ULTRA mode does not provide. Both can coexist in one installation, but routing is purpose-based and mutually exclusive: each task selects either ULTRA or the explicit plugin path, never both. Within the plugin path, Agentic Runner and Coding Agents remain independently installable and usable, and may optionally be paired. Routing stays explicit-only; Coding Agents dispatches workers only through official Codex subagents; and source repositories remain separate from disposable plugin cache. Using GPT-5.6 Sol ULTRA for the refactor is distinct from choosing a runtime route for a later task.

- [`678f9a9`](https://github.com/mlabo-org/coding-agents/commit/678f9a9224a562098f5909ee1037dd7677d79a96) — centralized shared scaffold contracts and reduced workflow-state overhead while retaining lifecycle, packet, and historical-compatibility checks.

The current source suite contains 61 passing tests.

## Platform

Verified on macOS 26.5.2 with Codex CLI 0.144.2, Node.js 24.18.0, and Git 2.55.0. The implementation uses Node.js standard-library APIs and Git, but other operating systems have not yet been verified.
